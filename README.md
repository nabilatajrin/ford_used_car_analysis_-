### Variables
Model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuelType, mpg, and engineSize.

### Tasks
1. Load the dataset
2. Explain the features and target variable
3. Deal with the missing values
4. Perform One-hot Encoding
5. Split the dataset into 80% training and 20% for testing. Add random state and stratification
6. Perform the training with Decision Tree Classifier
7. Show a tree diagram of the Decision Tree
8. Show the Confusion Matrix, Classification report, and ROC-AUC
9. Explain your outcome.
